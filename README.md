# ideas-as-issues

Just my thoughts and ideas as GitHub Issues.

## Motivation

I'm tired of having TODO lists and Idea lists in multiple apps. The tool that
has stayed consistent the longest is git and GitHub; so let's use it.

These ideas aren't limited to tech ideas.

Ideas are nothing without action, so take whatever you want from this list and
don't even both crediting me.

My goal isn't to become rich or famous from anything that I do; not that any of
these ideas will do either of those things.

## Inspiration

I don't remember how I stumbled across this repo:
